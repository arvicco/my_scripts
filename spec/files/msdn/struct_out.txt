      # MONCBSTRUCT Structure
      # --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      # The MONCBSTRUCT structure contains information about the current Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) 
      # transaction. A DDE debugging application can use this structure when monitoring transactions that the 
      # system passes to the DDE callback functions of other applications.
      # 
      # [*Typedef*] struct { UINT cb; DWORD dwTime; HANDLE hTask; DWORD dwRet; UINT wType; UINT wFmt; HCONV 
      #             hConv; HSZ hsz1; HSZ hsz2; HDDEDATA hData; ULONG_PTR dwData1; ULONG_PTR dwData2; 
      #             CONVCONTEXT cc; DWORD cbData; DWORD Data[8] } MONCBSTRUCT;
      # 
      # cb:: Specifies the structure's size, in bytes.
      # dwTime:: Specifies the Windows time at which the transaction occurred. Windows time is the number of 
      #          milliseconds that have elapsed since the system was booted.
      # hTask:: Handle to the task (application instance) containing the DDE callback function that received 
      #         the transaction.
      # dwRet:: Specifies the value returned by the DDE callback function that processed the transaction.
      # wType:: Specifies the transaction type.
      # wFmt:: Specifies the format of the data exchanged (if any) during the transaction.
      # hConv:: Handle to the conversation in which the transaction took place.
      # hsz1:: Handle to a string.
      # hsz2:: Handle to a string.
      # hData:: Handle to the data exchanged (if any) during the transaction.
      # dwData1:: Specifies additional data.
      # dwData2:: Specifies additional data.
      # cc:: Specifies a CONVCONTEXT structure containing language information used to share data in different 
      #      languages.
      # cbData:: Specifies the amount, in bytes, of data being passed with the transaction. This value can be 
      #          more than 32 bytes.
      # Data:: Contains the first 32 bytes of data being passed with the transaction (8 * sizeof(DWORD)).
