MONCBSTRUCT Structure

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The MONCBSTRUCT structure contains information about the current Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) transaction. A DDE debugging application can use this structure when monitoring transactions that the system passes to the DDE callback functions of other applications.

Syntax

typedef struct tagMONCBSTRUCT {
    UINT cb;
    DWORD dwTime;
    HANDLE hTask;
    DWORD dwRet;
    UINT wType;
    UINT wFmt;
    HCONV hConv;
    HSZ hsz1;
    HSZ hsz2;
    HDDEDATA hData;
    ULONG_PTR dwData1;
    ULONG_PTR dwData2;
    CONVCONTEXT cc;
    DWORD cbData;
    DWORD Data[8];
} MONCBSTRUCT, *PMONCBSTRUCT;
Members

cb
Specifies the structure's size, in bytes.
dwTime
Specifies the Windows time at which the transaction occurred. Windows time is the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since the system was booted.
hTask
Handle to the task (application instance) containing the DDE callback function that received the transaction.
dwRet
Specifies the value returned by the DDE callback function that processed the transaction.
wType
Specifies the transaction type.
wFmt
Specifies the format of the data exchanged (if any) during the transaction.
hConv
Handle to the conversation in which the transaction took place.
hsz1
Handle to a string.
hsz2
Handle to a string.
hData
Handle to the data exchanged (if any) during the transaction.
dwData1
Specifies additional data.
dwData2
Specifies additional data.
cc
Specifies a CONVCONTEXT structure containing language information used to share data in different languages.
cbData
Specifies the amount, in bytes, of data being passed with the transaction. This value can be more than 32 bytes.
Data
Contains the first 32 bytes of data being passed with the transaction (8 * sizeof(DWORD)).
