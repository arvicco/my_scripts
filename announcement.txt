== DESCRIPTION

A collection of simple scripts/commands used to save time and avoid memorizing/
retyping chains of boilerplate console commands and their arguments. Packaged
as a gem to make it easily available everywhere without the need to set up
paths, environments and all such nonsense... It is also not OS-specific, so
(in theory) scripts should work on Mac, *nix and Windows.

== CHANGES

* 1 major enhancement
  * Birthday!
